# **Tute_Dude_Python_Assignments_3**

Here I have uploaded two assignment files of python. Which are named as Task1.py and Task2.py respectivelly. Let me describe the functionality of each files separetlly.

                                                                           **TASK1**

Hear we have to calculate the factorial of number inserted by user using recursive function method. Recursive function means calling the same funtion inside the function. A function as the name implies is created to perform a specific task in a programm. At first we created a integer variable as n and call the input function to take input as a numbe. Then we created a function named as factorial and passed the variable n as an argument to the function. After that we use the if_else statemnt to make the factorial. By the way the factorial of anumber is the result of the multiplication of the number with all the whole numbers smaller then the number upto 1. Example: 5!=5*4*3*2*1 =120 but in this script we consider the last digit as 2  because multiplication by 1 is always same as the number.
Now we put the variable n in if statement and check if the number is smaller then 2 or not. if it found that it is smaller then it return true/value. where as the else part will return the value back after it nultiplys the valiable n with the function factorial with a decrementing argument as n-1. Then it prints the result from the factorial function.

                                                                            **TASK2**

Hear the task is to find out the squarroot, logarithm and sin of the user defind number using the built in module Math. A Module is a special python program which is pre-defind and used to perform specific task. At first we have imported the math module using the import statement, then we have initialized a integer variable named n and call the input function to take user input.then we first we print the squar root using the math.sqrt function with an argument pass as n variable. then we print the logarithm using the math.log function and passing the same variable as argument and atlast we print the sins by using the math.sin function and passing the same argument.
